## Summary

Crawling along the ground in a dense forest is where Sheldrake does his research. He is looking for fungus.

No, not the foot kind - the kind that has shaped our world in more ways than people understand. The first plants on dry land wouldn't exist without fungus. Animals wouldn't exist without plants. So it's not an unreasonable commentary for us to think we owe our existence, at least in part, to fungus.

When people think about fungus, they usually think about mushrooms. But mushrooms are just the fruit of fungus, like a flower is to a plant. Fungi grow under our feet in quantities that are unimaginable - there are six to ten times more species of fungi than plants. All of these wildly unique, yet still quite similar, fungi are doing things like: transferring genes between plants, passing nutrients to young saplings until they grow large enough to survive on their own, and even adorning the top of our expensive truffle fries at our local burger spot.

Sheldrake does a great job of exploring all the varying types of fungi and how they are impacting our world. He explores the origins of plant life, the magic mushrooms consumed for enjoyment, and the "wood wide web" that helps complex ecosystems communicate and react to changes in the environment.

## Key Takeaways

1. Fungi are incredibly important to our ecosystems and way of life as humans. Without them, we wouldn't survive and wouldn't exist.
2. Many fungi live within one root system of a plant, and a single fungi can live within the root systems of many plants.
3. More than 90% of all plant species depend on mycorrhizal fungi to survive. This is the same type of relationship that evolved to support algae making it out of the ocean and onto land.
4. Fungi help transfer resources between organisms and even within a single organisms. Resource transfer happens "downhill" in the same way that heat transfers to colder areas. This is critically important for plants that aren't efficient at consuming the resources necessary for their survival on their own. In fact, some plant species have completely lost the ability to perform photosynthesis because they get all their resources from fungal networks.

## Personal Thoughts

As someone who went to school to study molecular biology, this book was eye opening and fascinating. I loved Merlin's in depth and highly entertaining view on fungi and their influence on our daily lives. From the origin of life on land, to magic mushrooms, to truffles, and even coal, fungi play a role in how our world works and we don't even know it.

Some of the most interesting parts of this book were about how forests and trees communicate and share resources with each other through fungal networks. It feels like Avatar except it's real science! The "Wood Wide Web" as it's known in the fungi communities. Which, yeah, there is a huge world of amateur and professional fungi lovers who are studying everything from our environmental future to collect the truffles that infuse our expensive french fries.

Super entertaining read that I'd recommend to anyone interested in our planet, biology, or ecology.
