## Summary
AI is eating the world. Thirteen years ago, Mark Andreessen argued that software was eating the world, and that people weren't ready for the opportunity that existed ahead of them. Today, AI is eating the world, and people aren't ready for the opportunity that exists ahead of us. Knowing how to leverage the new hotness in AI (Large Language Models) is what will separate good from great. It will separate those who are actually 10x producers and those who are managed by them.

## Key Takeaways
1. Keep the four "rules" for co-intelligence in mind to leverage AI effectively:
	- Invite AI to the table. It will help you find the edges of your problem space and combat biases.
	- Be the human in the loop. LLMs will hallucinate and need your help to find the diamonds in the rough.
	- Treat AI as a person. You should tell it what it is and how you want it to behave.
	- Assume this is the worst AI will ever be. It's only smarter, faster, stronger(?) from here.
2. Knowledge is a commodity. Everyone can create convincing arguments for any topic in seconds. Knowing what to with the knowledge is more important.
3. Having a personal tutor is changing how we engage with experts. Students aren't leveraging experienced mentors because they can ask AI without sounding foolish. Experts aren't sharing their knowledge because they can use AI to produce something better and faster.

## Personal Thoughts
This book was a great introduction to the recent boom of large language models and how they work. LLMs are something that is going to change our society. Even if they stop improving (which is unlikely), I'm convinced our lives will all look very different in 5 years time as these tools are more and more integrated into our way of life. Ethan Mollick's book is a top notch introduction to LLMs and the technology leaps that have enabled them to happen. 

If you aren't using ChatGPT or other LLMs and are curious about them (or just want to know how to leverage them better), this book is a must read. I've built applications on top of LLMs and, even as someone intimately familiar with them, I learn a lot from Mollick. 

This is a short read - pick it up for sure and learn more about this alien technology we'll all be managing soon.
