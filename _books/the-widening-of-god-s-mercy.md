## Summary

The central premise of *The Widening of God's Mercy* is that God's mercy unfolds progressively throughout scripture, continually breaking down barriers to include those once considered outsiders. The authors trace God's mercy as it widens throughout scripture—beginning with Israel, extending to Gentiles, and culminating in the radical inclusivity of Jesus' ministry, which dismantles societal and religious boundaries to draw more people into the Kingdom of God.

This insight is both compelling and inspiring, as it highlights the dynamic nature of God's love. However, it also raises a critical theological question: Does the scriptural pattern of God's widening mercy authorize humans to keep expanding its scope today, particularly in ways that scripture does not explicitly address?

The authors argue that it does, pointing to examples of divine revelation in scripture—such as Peter's vision in Acts 10, where God commands him to accept Gentiles as clean—as evidence for this ongoing expansion. They suggest that the church is similarly called to discern and enact God's mercy in new ways, especially in its treatment of marginalized groups.

While I find the underlying narrative of God's widening mercy beautiful and deeply meaningful, I'm not convinced this argument is the strongest foundation for the destination the authors bring us to. It seems to rely heavily on the idea that human interpretation of God's intentions should guide further expansions of mercy, which risks detaching this process from God's explicit will as revealed in scripture.

That said, the book provides an inspiring reminder of the far-reaching nature of God's mercy. Throughout his ministry, Jesus consistently pushed the boundaries of those around him, dismantling cultural and religious norms that excluded people from God's presence. He welcomed the outcasts, healed the untouchables, and redefined holiness as a way of compassion and love. As followers of Christ, we are undoubtedly called to emulate this inclusivity and extend God's mercy to all.

In the end, while I may not fully agree with the authors' argument, I deeply appreciate their attempt to grapple with one of the most profound and vital themes in scripture: the boundless mercy of God and its implications for the church today.

## Personal Thoughts

### How this book changed my perspective

One of the most compelling insights from this book is its exploration of the inclusivity of God's Kingdom and how this theme unfolds throughout scripture. The authors bring this idea to life by anchoring it in two profound passages—one from the Old Testament and one spoken by Jesus himself:

In the aftermath of Israel's exile and the rebuilding of their society, the prophet Isaiah writes:
*"For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. Thus says the Lord God, who gathers the outcasts of Israel; I will gather others to them besides those already gathered."* - Isaiah 56:7-8

Centuries later, Jesus echoes this vision when addressing the Pharisees:
*"I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd."* - John 10:16

These passages, along with the broader context of Isaiah 56, are vivid reminders that God's mercy and Kingdom are far more expansive than we might expect. God's arms are always open wider than ours, often reaching out to those we would least anticipate.

What struck me most is how much of Jesus' ministry was dedicated to challenging narrow views of inclusion and encouraging us to think more broadly about the limitless grace of our God. He broke through cultural and religious barriers to embrace the marginalized, the outsider, and the unexpected. His actions teach us that God's mercy is not limited to those who seem to "belong" or fit within our definitions of faithfulness. Instead, it overflows to include those on the fringes, those we might overlook, and those we might even resist, including our enemies.

This perspective both humbles and challenges me. It reminds me that as followers of Christ, we are called to embody this radical inclusivity—not just as a reflection of God's mercy, but as a core expression of His character and Kingdom. It's a call to reevaluate our own boundaries, to seek out the overlooked, and to extend God’s love where it's needed most.
