## Summary
This book was an interesting set of stories about a few people in Texas who have lost or are losing their homes and communities due to the building of new highways. Ultimately, this book is about how the building of freeways, red-lining, and more have continued to hold minority and poor communities down. It was quite an interesting read, but eventually got a bit tedious as many of the stories and chapters are similar. 

## Key Takeaways
1. Expanding a freeway (adding more lanes) only alleviates traffic for about 6 months until people start traveling more due to the additional roadway capacity. Ultimately creating more traffic than was there originally.
