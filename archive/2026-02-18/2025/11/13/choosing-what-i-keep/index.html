  <div class="post-content content-wrapper-narrow animate-in animate-in-delay-1">
    <p>In college, I carried around this little stack of flashcards in a leather binding.</p>

<p>Bible verses. Tiny cards. Jammed in my pocket.</p>

<p>I would pull them out in line at the cafeteria, on the bus, or waiting for class to start. Flip, read, repeat. No system. No algorithm. I was just trying to <strong>hang on to words that were shaping me</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I <strong>stopped</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t know when it happened. Maybe work. Maybe building a company. Maybe just getting pulled forward by life. But somewhere along the way, I dropped the habit that had once meant a lot to me.</p>

<p>Over a decade passed. One day it hit me with that weird mix of nostalgia and loss.</p>

<p><em>I missed that little stack of cards.</em></p>

<p>Not for the aesthetic. For the feeling that I was <strong>choosing what I wanted to keep</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-forgetful-one">The forgetful one</h2>

<p>I am a very forgetful person.</p>

<p>Not in a cute sitcom way. In a “remember the idea, forget the details” way. Concepts dissolve. Verses fade. Books turn into vibes that my brain files under “good (I think?).”</p>

<p>At some point, you start to mistake the symptom for the identity. <strong>The person who reads a lot yet reaches for something and comes up empty.</strong> The person who has to rebuild mental models they’ve already built once before.</p>

<h2 id="buying-a-better-memory">Buying a better memory</h2>

<p>All the apps. All the systems. All the promises.</p>

<p>Most of them worked fine in the mechanical sense. Cards showed up. Reviews happened.</p>

<p>But things kept breaking.</p>

<p>The tiniest bit of friction wiped out my consistency. If I needed to remember to open the app, game over. <strong>Any habit that requires remembering the habit is doomed to fail.</strong></p>

<p>Beyond that, nothing in those apps helped me figure out the interesting frontier just beyond what I already knew. Nothing showed me the places where my understanding was thinner than I assumed.</p>

<p>It felt like <strong>I was collecting knowledge instead of growing it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="companion-for-curiosity">Companion for curiosity</h2>

<p>What I wanted was the spirit of that old leather stack, but with a brain.</p>

<p>Something gentle. Always nearby. Something that helped me remember what mattered without feeling like I was clocking into a job.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find that feeling, so I spent the last year trying to build it. It’s called Etch.</p>

<p>Etch has two instincts. One helps ideas stick. The other goes exploring.</p>

<p>You capture the things you care about and they <strong>show up on your home screen</strong> at just the right moment so they actually stick.</p>

<p>Then, Etch looks at what you know and goes exploring on your behalf. It might notice you know <em>hablar</em> and <em>comer</em> and write you a tiny lesson about Spanish ‘-ar’ verb patterns. Or it might connect your saved Seneca quotes to that note you wrote about how you spend your time.</p>

<p>It feels less like another productivity tool and more like having a <strong>companion for your curiosity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="i-kept-it">I kept it</h2>

<p>When something lands, I drop it into Etch. When something sparks, Insights feeds it. When life gets crowded and I can’t read much, the system still keeps me connected to the ideas I care about.</p>

<p>There are mornings when I unlock my phone, and the Etch widget flashes a question I haven’t seen in a year, like some tiny line from a book I only half‑remember reading. And my brain answers it before I’ve even had coffee. <strong>It lands clean, like muscle memory I didn’t know I had</strong>. Quiet proof that something I cared about didn’t wash away. It stayed. <strong>I kept it.</strong></p>

<p>It’s the same feeling I had with that old leather stack except now it actually sticks.</p>

<h2 id="make-memory-a-choice">Make memory a choice</h2>

<p>If you have also felt that quiet frustration of doing the work only to watch it fade. If you miss the feeling of actually keeping what matters.<br />
I built Etch for that.</p>

<p>Think of the first few things you want to hold onto for real. A principle. A quote that hit different. A concept you don’t want to lose.</p>

<p>And when you’re ready, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/etch-memory/id6741780207">download Etch from the App Store</a> and <strong>start etching them in</strong>.</p>
