      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide an Empire” is a revelatory journey through the often-overlooked territories of the United States. Despite frequently being a mere footnote in American history books, these lands tell a complex story of conquest, innovation, and moral depravity that challenges our understanding of what it means to be “American.”</p>

<p>From the nation’s first territory north of the Ohio River (acquired from Virginia two months before independence), to the sprawling network of nearly 800 military bases worldwide today, to the arm-twisting and coercion applied to ensure U.S. standards and cultures are normative around the world, Immerwahr uncovers fascinating tales that have been largely absent from mainstream historical narratives. Did you know that small islands made entirely of guano played a crucial role in feeding America’s booming 19th-century population? Or that Hawai’i was an unexpected catalyst for the civil rights movement? Immerwahr even recounts a surreal incident where the CIA outsmarted armed Honduran students by simply getting them drunk and tricking them into thinking they’d conquered the island.</p>

<p>But this isn’t just a collection of quirky historical anecdotes. Immerwahr doesn’t shy away from the darker chapters of American imperialism. He confronts us with uncomfortable truths: the abandonment of Filipinos to Japanese occupation (only for the U.S. military to later bomb our own people in an attempt to retake the island from Japan), horrific medical experiments on Puerto Ricans (including those conducted by Cornelius Rhoads, a celebrated pioneer of chemotherapy on the mainland), and the systematic displacement of native peoples across the mainland, Hawai’i, and Alaska. These stories force us to grapple with the human cost of empire-building and the contradictions inherent in America’s self-image.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Immerwahr poses a provocative question: Is the United States truly an empire? From its earliest days to its current global influence, America has always been more than just the familiar shape we see on maps. It’s an empire hiding in plain sight, shaping the world in ways both obvious and subtle.</p>

<p>“How to Hide an Empire” isn’t just a history lesson - it’s a mirror that reflects uncomfortable truths about American power, identity, and responsibility on the world stage. Whether you’re a history buff or simply curious about the hidden stories that shape our world, Immerwahr’s book offers a perspective-altering journey through the “Greater United States.”</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The United States of America is definitely an empire. We’ve always been an empire and will likely always be an empire. Whether it’s territorial conquest or our heavy influence on globalization, the influence of the United States around the world runs deep.</li>
  <li>One of the main reasons we’ve resisted extending statehood to territories is that, once a state, the residents go from U.S. Nationals to U.S. Citizens, gaining many important protections and rights in the process. In some cases, the United States didn’t want to extend those rights because it’s harder to control people with the rights of U.S. citizens. It also would put the U.S. in a position that required us to defend the land from enemies, which is something we frequently didn’t do when territories were attacked. The second main reason is that the U.S. government didn’t want to “tarnish” the white culture of the United States with foreign cultures.</li>
  <li>The primary way the United States exerts its influence as an empire today is via pushing our standards and cultures. Immerwahr tells the story of how 60* became the international thread type standard, and another of how English was subtly positioned as the primary universal language in nearly every professional industry.</li>
  <li>Douglas MacArthur, an American, drafted the Japanese constitution after getting frustrated at the poor quality of the constitution created by the Japanese. Interestingly, the constitution is still in place more than sixty years later with zero amendments.</li>
  <li>One of the primary catalysts to Osama Bin Laden’s extremist hatred of the United States was our empire of military bases in the Middle East - something Bin Laden saw as offensive to the religion of Islam. However, the major military base near Osama Bin Laden’s home was built in large part by his family’s construction company.</li>
  <li>The only reason Jefferson cared to execute the Louisiana Purchase was because of the sea ports it would afford in the gulf. Initially, the Louisiana Purchase would be shut up against whites with the exception of a small area around and including New Orleans. This obviously didn’t last long as white frontiersmen journeyed into the restricted land, claiming much of it for themselves and driving out native populations.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="favorite-quotes">Favorite Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Territories thus had no right to constitutional protections, for the simple reason that the Constitution didn’t apply to them. As one [Supreme Court] justice summarized the logic, the Constitution was “the supreme law of the land,” but the territories were “not part of the ‘land.”</p>

  <p><span class="page-number">- Page 84</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What kind of government is this?” asked one of the soldiers. “What are we that scream piously, ‘the world must be free,’ then keep it to ourselves?”</p>

  <p><span class="page-number">- Page 233</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Less touted in the textbooks are the admission of Alaska and Hawai’i as blows against racism. For the first time, the logic of white supremacy had not dictated which parts of the Greater United States were eligible for statehood.</p>

  <p><span class="page-number">- Page 241</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>College football was a popular sport in the 1920s, yet it wasn’t until 1940 that colleges agreed on what a “football” was. Home teams would just supply whatever vaguely football-shaped objects they wanted. Teams that liked to pass used slim balls, teams that emphasized kicking (which early football rules encouraged) proffered short and fat ones.</p>

  <p><span class="page-number">- Page 299</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what’s remarkable about English is that it’s the language with the most _non_native speakers. Estimates vary widely, but it seems that roughly one in four humans on the planet can now speak it.</p>

<h2 id="personal-thoughts">Personal Thoughts</h2>

<h3 id="how-this-book-changed-my-perspective">How this book changed my perspective</h3>

<p>Immerwahr’s book has profoundly expanded my understanding of American History and the nation’s global influence.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Redefined American Identity</strong>: The concept of “America” and what it means to be an “American” is much wider than the typical continental map we see most regularly. And, throughout history, identifying as an “American” is something that people across a huge variety of cultures and world regions have done.</li>
  <li><strong>Reassessment of Progress</strong>: While I’ve always known about some dark chapters in U.S. history, the extent of exploitation and experimentation in Puerto Rico as well as the complete abandonment and mass attack on Filipinos was shocking. It’s made me recognize and be more critical of how we measure progress, specifically how we measure who benefits and at what cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden Influences on Global Culture</strong>: The U.S. influence is embedded in global standards and practices, from screw threads to the English language, to road signage. It’s made me more aware of the subtle ways empires can exert power beyond traditional colonialism - especially so in this age of globalization.</li>
  <li><strong>Complexity of Statehood</strong>: I now have a more nuanced understanding of why certain territories haven’t become states. The book revealed how racism and strategic interests have played significant roles in these decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Importance of Inclusive History</strong>: This book has reinforced for me the value of studying history from multiple perspectives, especially those often marginalized and overlooked.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-applications">Practical applications</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make a conscious effort to read books, watch documentaries, or listen to podcasts that offer perspectives from marginalized groups and lesser-known aspects of history.</li>
  <li>Look for opportunities to support and advocate for more comprehensive history education in schools.</li>
  <li>Use my vote and voice to advocate for more equitable policies, both within the United States and worldwide.</li>
  <li>When evaluating technological and societal progress, make sure to consider who is benefiting and who is bearing the costs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questions-for-further-exploration">Questions for further exploration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In what ways does climate change alter the strategic importance of certain U.S. territories or military installations?</li>
  <li>How does the U.S. differ from empires of old that have fallen? Is there anything we can learn from their downfall to avoid the same fate?</li>
  <li>How does this more comprehensive understanding of U.S. imperial history impact my view of domestic policies and attitudes toward immigration?</li>
  <li>In what ways does the standardization of technology and communications (including the large amount of innovation in the U.S.) continue to shape global power dynamics?</li>
</ul>
