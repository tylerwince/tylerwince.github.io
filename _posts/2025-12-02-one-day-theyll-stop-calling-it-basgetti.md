You won't notice when it happens.

Somewhere between Tuesday breakfast and Saturday dinner, "basgetti" becomes "spaghetti." The lisp disappears. The mispronunciation you found so endearing just... **stops.**

**And you realize you don't remember the last time they said it wrong.**

Childhood doesn't slam doors. It slips out quietly while you're busy making lunches and answering emails.

## The Apple Note

My wife figured this out early.

She kept a single Apple Note with every mispronunciation, every ridiculous observation, every tiny burst of kid-logic.

It worked until it didn't.

We couldn't share it. I'd miss things for days. We couldn't attach their voices. We couldn't filter or find anything without scrolling forever.

**The words were there. The *texture* was gone.**

So we built something better.

## Little Quotes

Now when one of our kids says something worth saving, I pull down and type it in. If I’m quick enough, I hit record and catch their actual voice. Sometimes I snap a photo—the backseat, the park bench, the kitchen table at 7am.

Each kid has their own timeline. Years from now, I’ll scroll back and watch their language grow—from toddler nonsense to surprisingly sharp observations.

And it’s not just me. My wife adds quotes when I’m at work. The grandparents add them when they’re babysitting. Everyone sees updates instantly.

When you half-remember something they said about the moon three years ago? You search it, and it’s right there.

## The real feature

Kids don't announce the last time they'll say something in that tiny voice. The moments just slip, unceremonious and irreversible.

Little Quotes is how you pin them to time instead of letting them vanish.

In five years, you'll want to hear those words. **In twenty years, they'll want to hear them too.**
