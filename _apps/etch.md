## What is Etch?

**Etch is a native iOS spaced repetition flashcard app**—what Anki would have been if developed by Apple. It uses scientifically-proven learning techniques to help you retain information for longer periods with less study time.

The app automatically schedules your reviews at optimal intervals using the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm, ensuring you study at the perfect moment to remember information for a lifetime.

## Key Features

### Smart Spaced Repetition
Etch uses the advanced FSRS algorithm to intelligently schedule your flashcard reviews. The system adapts to your performance in real-time, adjusting difficulty based on how well you remember each card.

### Flexible Card Types
- **Forward cards**: Traditional one-way learning

### Beautiful Organization
- **Stack System**: Group flashcards with custom colors and SF Symbol icons
- **Full-Text Search**: Find any card or insight instantly

## The Science Behind It

Spaced repetition is backed by decades of cognitive psychology research. By reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals, you can:
- **Study less, remember more**
- **Counteract the forgetting curve**
- **Build long-term retention**

Etch's FSRS algorithm is the most advanced scheduling system available, providing even better results than traditional spaced repetition implementations.
