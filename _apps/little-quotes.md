## What makes it special

**Quick capture that fits real life**  
Pull down to type, attach photos, and save. No friction, even when your hands are full.

**Smart organization you don't have to manage**  
Profiles, tagging, and instant search keep every quote easy to find. A beautiful timeline shows how your littles' voices grow over time.

**Share privately with the people who matter**  
Invite family to contribute and see updates in real time. Everything syncs through iCloud so memories stay in your circle.

## Privacy & Security

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Little Quotes does not collect your data.</strong> Quotes, photos, audio, video, and context live on your devices and sync privately via iCloud—no analytics, no ads, no trackers.</p>
  <p>Your family's memories stay within your shared circle. No data is ever sold or shared.</p>
  <p>Requirements: iOS 17.0 or later with an iCloud account for sync and sharing features.</p>
