## What is Waymark?

**Waymark is a beautifully designed iOS prayer tracking app** that helps Christians build consistent prayer habits, track their spiritual progress, celebrate answered prayers, and share their faith journey with family and faith communities.

Unlike generic task managers, Waymark is purpose-built for prayer—helping you remember the people and situations that matter most, while maintaining a private and sacred space for your conversations with God.

## Key Features

### Prayer Lists & Organization
Create customizable prayer lists with emoji icons and colors. Organize your prayers by category, person, or situation—whatever structure helps you pray most effectively.

### Smart Prayer Reminders
Set flexible prayer schedules with daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cadences. Waymark intelligently reminds you when it's time to pray, helping you build a consistent prayer habit.

### Prayer Sessions
Enter focused prayer time with optional timers. Waymark guides you through your prayer list, helping you stay present and intentional.

### Answered Prayer Tracking
Record and celebrate when God answers your prayers. Add photos, notes, and details about how He showed up. Build a visible record of God's faithfulness in your life.

### Anniversary Notifications
Waymark automatically notifies you on prayer anniversaries—1 week, 1 month, 1 year, and beyond. Celebrate milestones and reflect on God's faithfulness over time.

### Home Screen Widget
Keep prayer at the front of your mind with a beautiful home screen widget that displays your prayer prompts throughout the day.

### Cloud Sync & Sharing
- **Automatic iCloud Sync**: Your prayers stay synchronized across all your devices
- **Prayer Sharing**: Create collaborative prayer lists with family or faith community
- **Privacy Protected**: All data is encrypted with CloudKit

### Search Everything
Quickly find any prayer, note, or answered prayer with full-text search across your entire prayer history.

- **Christians** who want to build a more consistent prayer life
- **Families** praying together for shared needs
- **Small Groups** supporting each other in prayer
- **Church Members** collaborating on congregation prayers
- **Anyone** seeking to grow their relationship with God through prayer

## Why Waymark?

### Privacy First
- Zero analytics or tracking
- Full CloudKit encryption

- No corporate data mining

### Spiritual Focus
Built specifically for prayer, not adapted from a task manager. Every feature is designed to support your spiritual life and relationship with God.

### Beautiful Design
Clean, modern SwiftUI interface that respects the sacred nature of prayer. Customizable with emojis and colors to make it your own.

### Independent Creator
Made with ❤️ by an individual developer who cares about helping Christians grow in prayer, not maximizing engagement metrics.

## Privacy Policy

**Waymark Prayer does not collect any of your data.**

All lists, prayers, images, and notes are stored on your device and backed up to your private Apple iCloud account using [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/). All prayer title, notes, list names, list notes, answered prayer notes, and images are encrypted with your private Apple encryption key.

Waymark Prayer does not display any advertisements, or include any trackers/analytics.
