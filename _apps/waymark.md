## Why Waymark

Keep prayer commitments meaningful with gentle reminders, journaling, and space to celebrate answered prayers. Build rhythms alone or invite your community into the journey.

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Rhythms that stick</h3>
    <p>Gentle reminders and lightweight scheduling keep you praying daily without the guilt trip.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>A sacred record</h3>
    <p>Journal during prayers and be reminded of how God answered your prayers in the past.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>Share with others</h3>
    <p>Invite family or small groups to shared lists. Sync updates automatically so everyone prays in step.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Free, forever

Waymark is free to use—no paywalls or subscriptions. It's a labor of love for believers who want prayer to feel intentional and be reminded of how God answers.

## Screenshots

<div class="screenshot-strip">
  {% for screenshot in (1..6) %}
  <figure class="screenshot-card">
    <img src="/assets/waymark-screeshots/{{ screenshot }}.jpg" alt="Waymark screenshot {{ screenshot }}" loading="lazy">
  </figure>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Privacy & Trust

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Waymark never collects your prayer data.</strong> Everything stays on-device and syncs privately via CloudKit. Titles, notes, and images are encrypted end-to-end if you enable Advanced Data Protection.</p>
  <p>Your prayers are sacred. Waymark was built to honor that.</p>
